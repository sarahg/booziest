# Booziest ~ http://booziest.beer

## About
This is a PHP-based web app that hooks into the Untappd API and allows you to view a user's Untappd beer check-ins, sorted by ABV.

## Archived!
This was a fun lil project, but Untappd now shows this data under your "Beer History" on the website (you can sort that by ABV). This is no longer maintained and probably no longer actually works. I also relinquished the booziest.beer domain name, even though it was awesome, because it was going to cost too much to renew. :) 

## Thanks
+ [Untappd](http://untappd.com), your API is fun. And [this guy Greg](https://github.com/gregavola/UntappdPHP) who made a nice PHP library for connecting to Untappd.
+ [Dangerous Man's](http://dangerousmanbrewing.com) Imperial Hemp Brown Ale inspired the idea of being able to see Untappd data ordered by ABV. This is currently my #1 booziest beer.
+ [Bent Paddle's](http://www.bentpaddlebrewing.com) Cold Press Black Ale was the beverage of choice during the prototyping stage.
