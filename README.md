# booziest.beer

## About
This is a PHP-based web app that hooks into the Untappd API and allows you to sort Untappd checkin data by ABV, among other things.

## Roadmap
- Add social sharing.
- Add functionality for comparing your results to other users' results.

## Thanks
+ [Untappd](http://untappd.com), your API is fun. And [this guy Greg](https://github.com/gregavola/UntappdPHP) who made a nice PHP library for connecting to Untappd.
+ [Dangerous Man's](http://dangerousmanbrewing.com) Imperial Hemp Brown Ale inspired the idea of being able to see Untappd data ordered by ABV. This is currently my #1 booziest beer.
+ [Bent Paddle's](http://www.bentpaddlebrewing.com) Cold Press Black Ale was the beverage of choice during the prototyping stage.
