# Booziest ~ http://booziest.beer 

## About 
This is a PHP-based web app that hooks into the Untappd API and allows you to sort Untappd checkin data by ABV, among other things.

## Dev
+ To make front-end changes, you'll need to run `npm install` initially and then `grunt build` to compile SCSS and JavaScript.

## Thanks
+ [Untappd](http://untappd.com), your API is fun. And [this guy Greg](https://github.com/gregavola/UntappdPHP) who made a nice PHP library for connecting to Untappd.
+ [Dangerous Man](http://dangerousmanbrewing.com)'s Imperial Hemp Brown Ale inspired the idea of being able to see Untappd data ordered by ABV. This is currently my #1 booziest beer.
+ [Bent Paddle](http://www.bentpaddlebrewing.com)'s Cold Press Black Ale was the beverage of choice during the early prototyping stage here.
